# Overview

This repository contains a computer-readable version (in
[LaTeX](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) format) of one of the many reports on the
U.S. Department of Defense’s struggle with software acquisition.

The report here, the 1987 Defense Science Board report (led by Fred Brooks,
famous for [Brooks’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law)), is
available today from the DoD's [DTIC
website](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a188561.pdf) as a scanned
PDF. Although the text is already OCR’d (which made it possible to convert), it
was scanned from a poor quality original and as a result is both hard to read
at times and very large to download.

So I took it upon myself to make a version that I could post on a Github.

Right now there is just the LaTeX source and the generated PDF itself. Later I
might try to do an HTML conversion but for now I am happy with where it is at.
